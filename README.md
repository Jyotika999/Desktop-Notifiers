# Desktop Notifications using 'plyer'

Notifications are some tiny text pop-ups that appear on the desktop ðŸ’» or mobile screen to inform the user about the updates or any other vital pieces of information, allowing the user to focus ðŸ’¡on essential things and ignore the non-important ones.


Plyer is basically a module that is used to mainly access the hardware features. Plyer is a cross-platform library that actually works on mobile too when used with Kivy. Plyer has way more than just notification tools. It can do screenshots, text-to-speech, vibration, GPS, Bluetooth, audio, accelerometer, and more!

Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML, which is useful for web scraping


According to the Documentation at PyPI:
The Python Package Index (PyPI) is a repository of software for the Python programming language.
Plyer is a platform-independent API to use features commonly found on various platforms, notably mobile ones, in Python.
